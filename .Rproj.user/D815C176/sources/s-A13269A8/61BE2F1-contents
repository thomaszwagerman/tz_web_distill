I work as a **Spatial Data Analyst** at the [Centre for Ecology and Hydrology](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/) in the group Emissions, Sources, Sinks and Solutions.

I work on a range of national and international projects, mainly doing spatial modelling of emissions and air pollutants, with a focus on ammonia and nitrogen from agriculture.

* Storage, manipulation and visualisation of geospatial and environmental data in R.
