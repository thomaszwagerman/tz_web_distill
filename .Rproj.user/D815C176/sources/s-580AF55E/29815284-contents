I work as a **Spatial Data Analyst** at the [Centre for Ecology and Hydrology](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/) in the group Emissions, Sources, Sinks and Solutions.

I work on a range of national and international projects, mainly doing spatial modelling of emissions and air pollutants, with a focus on ammonia and nitrogen from agriculture. 

_Skills & Experience:_

* Storage, manipulation and visualisation of geospatial and environmental data in R.
* ArcGIS & QGIS.
* Database management with FME, SQL, Oracle & Access.
* Development and maintenance of interactive R Shiny web applications.
* Report writing and distribution of data with R Markdown.

I have a **BSc in Ecological & Environmental Sciences** from the University of Edinburgh. I wrote my dissertation on vegetation change impact on arctic land-atmosphere interactions and snowmelt in the Arctic, and coded with a mix of Python and R. I was awarded the J.A More Memorial Prize for best dissertation on a plant or crop topic.
 
My first stepts in R coding were at the [Coding Club](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/). I learned most of my spatial R from [Geocomputation with R by Robin Lovelace](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/). Now I get to teach as an instructor on [Transforming Environmental Data in R](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/training/transforming-environmental-data-r).
