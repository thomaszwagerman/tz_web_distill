I work as an **Environmental Data Scientist** at the [Centre for Ecology and Hydrology](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/).

I develop tools and processes for the automated processing and quality assurance of air quality and climate change datasets, as well as develop interactive dissemination tools and reports for customers and stakeholders.

I use R for almost everything, with sometimes a bit of Python. Other tools I use as required are Jinja, JavaScript, CSS & HTML.

My previous role at UKCEH was as a Spatial Data Analyst, where I developed skills in using spatial data formats and software.

I have a **BSc in Ecological & Environmental Sciences** from the University of Edinburgh. I wrote my dissertation on vegetation change impact on arctic land-atmosphere interactions and snowmelt in the Arctic, and coded with a mix of Python and R. I was awarded the J.A. More Memorial Prize for best dissertation on a plant or crop topic.
 
My first stepts in R coding were at the [Coding Club](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/). 

Currently my favourite R books are [Mastering Shiny by Hadley Wickham](https://mastering-shiny.org/) and [Efficient R programming by Colin Gillespie and Robin Lovelace](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/). 

When I worked as a Spatial Data Analyst, I learned most of my spatial R from [Geocomputation with R by Robin Lovelace](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/). 

I currently teach as an instructor on [Transforming Environmental Data in R](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/training/transforming-environmental-data-r), which runs 2-4 times a year.
